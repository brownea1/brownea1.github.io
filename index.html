        <h1>About</h1>
        
        <p>My name is Ethan Brown and I am a Junior Software Engineering student with minors in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. I have shown academic success, campus involvement, leadership and much more during my time at Rose-Hulman. I have been honored to be on the Dean’s List every quarter since I started at Rose-Hulman, and I have been initiated into Alpha Lambda Delta, a fraternity for students who show academic excellence during their freshman year. I have also shown leadership by being on Pi Kappa Alpha’s executive board as the Health and Safety chair.</p>
        
        <p>Along with my academic excellence, I have been able to have many great technical experiences. Over the summer of 2022 I was a Co-Op for Toyota Connected Technologies, where I streamlined and automated the Voice Assistant team’s testing process. During my time at Toyota, I also participated in a hackathon where I contributed a solution to detect and prevent drunk driving, that I hope will be seen in future Toyota vehicles. My team and I are working on filing a patent for the data science solution.</p>
        
        <p>I also have a very strong desire to learn more about computer science and machine learning. For example, I am currently working on remaking my entire online portfolio using React and embedding Java projects using JavaServer Pages. I am also teaching myself C++ to strengthen my programming skills.</p>
